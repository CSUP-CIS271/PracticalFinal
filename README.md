# PracticalFinal
Your final for this class

You have all semester to do this. It is due no later than the last Thursday before finals.

Your final will have:

A GUI interface that takes user input.

Allow user to input a roman numeral.

Convert that roman numeral into arabic numbers.

The input must be in correct roman numeral format.

For example IV = 4, not IIII

A good article to read is http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/08/27/even-when-not-in-romeyou-should-know-your-roman-numerals/

Prompt the user if the input is incorrect format.
